<p align="justify">As a Python developer, I specialize in building reliable
web APIs and optimizing performance. I am detail-
oriented and write clean, maintainable code.
I have experience working with the FastAPI
framework, using it to develop high-performance,
scalable REST services. With FastAPI, I have
implemented authentication systems, handled
asynchronous requests, and integrated databases using
SQLAlchemy.
I am ready to contribute to high-performance projects
where quality, scalability, and stability are essential.</p>
